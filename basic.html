    		<div id="rightside"><p>The Pixie Project focuses on finding life-long matches between pet and adopter and for that reason our adoption process is a bit more in depth than some other shelters. We appreciate the opportunity to sit down and talk with any person or family looking to adopt a new pet so we can best help them find an animal that suits their home and lifestyle. We have a variety of animals of all ages, sizes and breeds, so if you are considering adding a pet to your home please start theprocess by filling out an application! Once that’s complete, we’ll make an appointment with you to make sure that you get the personalized attention and service you and your new pet deserve. Read more about our adoption philosophy.

			The Pixie Project is raising the bar on animal rescue! Located in Portland, Oregon, Pixie’s goal is to transform animal adoption and rescue into a fun, family-friendly and positive experience by taking a hands-on, personal approach to each and every adoption. Pixie is committed to the art of match-making between pet and person!</p></div>
