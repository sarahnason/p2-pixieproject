                <br>
                <p>Hi! Hello! Are you ready to play? I sure am! My name is Chloe and I am a beautiful 1 year old Cattle dog mix weighing just 30lbs. With a spring in my step and a mind as sharp as a tack, I am a working gal looking for an experienced owner to teach me some new tricks! It can take a little for me to warm up to my new adult friends, especially men, but once I do, I am full of hugs and kisses. I can be a lot when it comes to meeting new dogs friends and not every pup loves my play style, but I have made a few friends at Pixie that I really get along with. And they have thought me some nice manners! When I am not running around the play yard with my doggy pals, I enjoy playing fetch with some toys or playing other interactive food toys that help stimulate my active mind. I bet I would even love to do some fun nose work exercises if you could teach me! I am a rural gal through and through, so downtown city life isn’t for me. I would need an owned home in a low traffic neighborhood and outside the city would be ideal. I would need an adult only home with no cats, but I would enjoy the company of a confident adult male dog who could keep up with me! Even after a day of activity,  I still love to curl up on the couch with you while eat some popcorn and watch some movies. Smart, bubbly, and oh so gorgeous, I am ready to play with you today! Fill out an application, so we can meet. I come to you vaccinated, spayed, and micro-chipped with an adoption fee of $350.</p>

                <br>
                <p>My name is Minerva, and I’m an adorable and petite little calico kitty that is just over one-year-old. Wherever my people are, that’s where I want to be, and I’m always right there to greet them when they come home. I have a cute little chirpy meow and sometimes I can be very talkative, especially when food or treats are involved. I love cat treats or any human food, and will be more than happy to lick up any leftovers! While I am a little bit active and do like to climb, I am very careful with people things and make sure not to knock anything over. I didn’t grow up around any other cats or dogs, so would definitely prefer to be the only animal in the house—however, I am a pro at meeting new people and have enough love to give so that you won’t feel like you’re missing out with me around! My favorite place to sleep is on top of my human, mostly on their chest and neck. I want lots of petting before I sleep at night, as soon as you wake up, I’ll be ready for more loving.  I don’t mind being held as long as I can climb on a shoulder; sometimes I’ll stick around on your shoulders and come with you. I’m used to living entirely indoors and am perfectly happy as an apartment kitty. I hope you’re as excited to meet me as I am you! Won’t you fill out an adoption application to meet me today? I’m currently residing in a foster home, and come to you fixed, vaccinated, and micro-chipped for an adoption fee of $100.</p>

                <p>♫ Coolest kid on the block, this kid won’t stop. I am always on the go until I am not. The name is Petey Pawblo and I am here to play, still working on things like “sit” and “stay. At 4 months old and just 13 lbs, my love for all people knows no bounds. A puggle is what they say I am, but whatever the mix, I am a total ham!” Whew, I spit some mad rhymes, don’t I?! Well that’s not all I can do! My silly puppy antics are also enough to turn any frown upside down. From chasing my toys to tripping over my growing puppy feet, I am quite the comedian. Being a very curious boy, I am always eager to learn more about the world and would love for you to teach me! PUPPY CLASSES ARE MANDATORY FOR MY ADOPTION! I enjoy playing with my dog and cat pals, and would be happy to have a calm adult dog sibling who can show me the ropes. I am a pretty needy guy and when it comes to wanting affection from my people, I just can’t get enough! It makes it harder when they have to leave for the workday, but I am learning that I get yummy tasty kongs and treats which makes it a little better. I still would do best in an owned home with a family who has a predictable schedule to help me establish a routine. I’m pawsitively adorable in every way and am ready to spin beats with you today! Fill out an application, so we can set up a meet. I come to you neutered, micro-chipped, and vaccinated with an adoption fee of $400.</p>

      <h1>about</h1>
      <p >Our philosophy at Pixie is simple and unique: find the perfect pet for each person or family. At Pixie we’re not about getting animals out the door, we’re about getting pets into lifetime homes. Sometimes the “right” pet is waiting for you, and other times you may have to search for a while before your canine or feline soul-mate arrives. We promise, it will be worth the wait!</p>

      <mark>Changing the Face of Animal Rescue</mark><br>
    The Pixie Project is a non-profit animal adoption center and rescue. We offer a variety of services to the public including but not limited to: pet adoption services, pet owner education and support and low cost and free spay and neuter and veterinary services for homeless and low-income pet owners. We are located directly across the street from the convention center at 510 NE MLK BLVD.<br><br>
    <mark>Where our animals come from</mark><br>
    The Pixie Project’s adoptable animals come from a variety of places but the majority are from surrounding over-crowded county shelters and rescues located in more rural areas of Oregon. As many of these areas are not served by a local shelter we provide an urban outlet where the animals can have maximum visibility and exposure to potential adopters. Animals that come to our rescue also have access to veterinary and training support to meet any and all needs.<br><br>
    <mark>Our adoption philosophy</mark><br>
    The Pixie Project focuses on finding life-long matches between pet and adopter and for that reason our adoption process is a bit more in depth than some other shelters. We appreciate the opportunity to sit down and talk with any person or family looking to adopt a new pet so we can best help them find an animal that suits their home and lifestyle. We have a variety of animals of all ages, sizes and breeds, so if you are considering adding a pet to your home please start theprocess by filling out an application! Once that’s complete, we’ll make an appointment with you to make sure that you get the personalized attention and service you and your new pet deserve. Read more about our adoption philosophy. The Pixie Project is raising the bar on animal rescue! Located in Portland, Oregon, Pixie’s goal is to transform animal adoption and rescue into a fun, family-friendly and positive experience by taking a hands-on, personal approach to each and every adoption. Pixie is committed to the art of match-making between pet and person!<br><br>
    <mark>Veterinary Care</mark><br>
    In addition to providing amazing adoption services, The Pixie Project runs a low-cost veterinary clinic. The Scott Wainner Pixie Care Clinic offers low income and homeless pet owners access to vital veterinary care. Over the last year, the Pixie Project has increased the number of surgeries performed by more than 5 times. A skilled team of high-volume veterinarians and vet techs can now perform twenty surgeries during our once-a-week surgery day. These surgeries are a combination of spay/neuter and emergency services, including dental extractions, amputations, mass removals, and other life-saving surgeries. Our goal is not only to prevent overpopulation though easy access to spay/neuter surgeries, but to keep beloved pets in their existing homes. When pet owners fall on hard times (including, in many cases, seniors living on social security) they may not be able to afford a necessary surgery at a traditional vet, forcing them to surrender their beloved companion to already over-full shelters or consider euthanasia. Many of these animals are seniors themselves who have very limited adoption opportunities. Pixies is able to help keep these owners and pets together by performing affordable surgeries and assisting with medications.

  <h1>volunteer</h1>
    <p>Volunteering is a great way to enrich your life and the lives of animals. Through the help of volunteers we are able to provide one-on-one socialization for the animals as well as a clean and safe living environment. Volunteers are key in supporting staff, assisting in the care of the animals and helping to spread the word about Pixie’s work throughout the community. Whether you are a dog person, cat person, or a little bit of both, we have plenty of ways for you to help! The first step in becoming a Pixie volunteer is to attend on of our volunteer orientations.<br><br>
    <i>ATTENTION POTENTIAL VOLUNTEERS: Due to the overwhelming amount of volunteer interest we receive, we may not have a new orientation available for several weeks. We appreciate your patience and your willingness to support animals in need!</i></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p style="column-count: 2;">
    <mark>WINTER/SPRING 2020 ORIENTATION DATES:</mark><br>

    Wednesday, May 13th from 6pm-7pm & Saturday, May 30th from 9am-10am<br>
    If you are interested in attending an orientation, please email your full name and the date you’re interested in to <u>volunteer@pixieproject.org</u> so we can sign you up and provide the details. Orientations are generally NOT held at the shelter. We are looking for volunteers who can commit to volunteering for at least 3 months.<br><br>

    NOTE: For liability and insurance reasons, we can only accept volunteers who are 16 years or older.<br><br>
    <mark>Dog Walker</mark><br>
    Dog walkers help socialize our dogs to meeting new people both inside and outside of the shelter. They allow dogs to get out of the building and into the fresh air for some exercise, and also provide valuable feedback on the dog’s personality and how they react to stimuli in the big city. Dog walking shifts are available in 30-60 minute increments Tues-Fri 11-6 and Sat 11-4. Due to the popularity of this volunteer job, we limit dog-walking volunteers to two shifts per week. Due to the busyness of the area, this is an individual opportunity and is generally not available for couples or pairs.<br><br>

    <mark>Dog Kennels</mark><br>
    Volunteers in our kennel area will help us with a multitude of “behind the scenes” tasks including potty walks, cutting up treats, baths, making kongs, and LOTS of cleaning!  Going through dog walking training is a prerequisite for this job, and dog-walking volunteers frequently help in this area when needs arise / if they are willing!<br><br>

    <mark>Cattery</mark><br>
    Cattery volunteers will help staff maintain the cleanliness of the cattery and provide playtime and socialization for the kitties. They will also be responsible for cleaning and handling cats in the isolation area. Cattery shifts are available twice a day (morning and evening) 7 days a week. The morning shifts begin at 10 am and the evening shift starts at 5 pm. Each shift generally lasts 1-2 hours.<br><br>

    <mark>Events and Outreach</mark><br>
    Event volunteers assist by representing Pixie at events and talking to the public about where our animals come from and the positives of animal adoption. They help nurture community partnerships and educate the public about our many community services including our low-cost clinic and other services. They also help us fundraise much-needed money to keep our program running and growing!<br><br>

    <mark>Transport</mark><br>
    Do you have a car and a desire to help Pixie? You can be a transporter!  We are in need of volunteers to help us pick up animals as well as donations. The need ranges from in-town transports to out of town road trips, so let us know what you are interested in!
